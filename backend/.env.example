# Example environment variables for Timesheet Invoice App backend
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your secrets

# REQUIRED: Session secret for production (use a long random string, at least 32 characters)
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here

# Database path (default: ./data/app.db)
DATABASE_PATH=./data/app.db

# Authentication credentials
# IMPORTANT: In production, you MUST set APP_PASSWORD or APP_PASSWORD_HASH
# The default "admin/admin" credentials will be rejected in production
APP_USERNAME=admin
# Option 1: Set plain password (will be hashed at startup)
APP_PASSWORD=admin

# Option 2: Pre-hashed password (RECOMMENDED for production - more secure than plain password)
# Generate with: bun -e "import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'; console.log(await bcrypt.hash('your-password', 12))"
# APP_PASSWORD_HASH=

# Environment (development or production)
# NODE_ENV=production

# CORS: Comma-separated list of allowed origins (required if frontend is on different domain)
# If not set in production, CORS will be disabled (assumes same-origin deployment)
# Example: ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://timesheet.mydomain.com,https://app.example.com
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS=

# Allow requests with no origin header (e.g., Postman, mobile apps) - defaults to false
# Set to true in development for testing tools that don't send Origin header
# NOT RECOMMENDED in production - use explicit ALLOWED_ORIGINS instead
# ALLOW_NO_ORIGIN_IN_DEV=true

# Timezone (default: Pacific/Auckland)
# TZ=Pacific/Auckland
